    <h1>CATS</h1>
    <p>The <b>cat (Felis catus) </b>is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.
        It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to 
        as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
        <u>A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely 
        and avoids human contact.</u>Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their
         ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.

                  <h3><u>Anatomy of Cat</u></h3>
                  <p>The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong 
                      flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to
                       killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. 
                       Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, 
                       hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. 
                       A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk, the cat is a solitary hunter
                      but a social species. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for
                       human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals.It secretes and perceives 
                       pheromones.</p>

                  <h4><u>Life span of Cats</u></h4>
                  <p>The average lifespan of pet cats has risen in recent decades. In the early 1980s,
                       it was about seven years, rising to 9.4 years in 1995 and 15.1 years in 2018.
                       Some cats have been reported as surviving into their 30s,with the oldest known cat,
                        Creme Puff, dying at a verified age of 38.</p>
              </section><br>
              <aside>
                  <p>Diseases affecting domestic cats include acute infections, parasitic infestations,
                       injuries, and chronic diseases such as kidney disease, thyroid disease, and arthritis.
                        Vaccinations are available for many infectious diseases, as are treatments to 
                        eliminate parasites such as worms and fleas.About two hundred fifty heritable
                        genetic disorders have been identified in cats, many similar to human inborn 
                        errors of metabolism. The high level of similarity among the metabolism of
                         mammals allows many of these feline diseases to be diagnosed using genetic tests 
                         that were originally developed for use in humans, as well as the use of cats as 
                         animal models in the study of the human diseases</p>
